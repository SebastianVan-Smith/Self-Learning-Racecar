I've always wanted to make one of these!
this is a car game, the objective is to maximise the score. you loose if you go into the wall.

the score is the distance traveled / time taken this is to stop you going really slowly arround the track.

it is controlled by the arrow keys (or wsad), the speed will slowly decay to give it a weighted feel. reversing works kinda ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

press p for someone better to take over the car. - it is also the key to start the auto learning of the car
