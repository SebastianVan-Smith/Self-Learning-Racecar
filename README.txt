**README**
I've always wanted ot make one of these!
this is a car game the, objective is to maximise the store. you loose if you go into the wall

the score is the distance traveled/ time this is to stop you going really slowly arround the track.

it is controlled by the arrow keys, the speed will slowly decay to give it a weighted feel. reversing works kinda

press p for someone better to take over the car.
